A collection of Google Apps Scripts I've written:

* [**Google Calendar Sync**](https://github.com/caodonnell/COD-GoogleAppScripts/tree/main/GoogleCalendarSync): I wrote this script because I have a work Google Calendar that we use for scheduling meetings, etc. and a personal Google Calendar where I put my personal things (doctor's appointments, workouts, personal meetings, etc.). I wanted the personal events to show up on my work calendar so that people wouldn't schedule meetings at those times, but sync it without including all of the personal details. I couldn't find a (free) services that would do it in the way I wanted, so I wrote a script.
* [**Google Drive Audit**](https://github.com/caodonnell/COD-GoogleAppScripts/tree/main/GoogleDriveAudit): This script was designed to audit Google Drive folders/directories. I'm on projects that have very complicated folder structures, especially for projects that have been around for awhile and/or undergone many personnel changes (and therefore different norms/practices for organizing files/folders), and so we needed a way to know what exists in our directories.

... and more to come!
