# Google Calendar Sync script
I have a work calendar and a personal calendar. I don't want to put everything into a single calendar, and having to create holds
on my work calendar every time I addded something to my personal calendar was a pain. I tried a few different apps that can sync
calendars, but was never happy - either they only pulled events for the next 2 weeks (and I want to be able to schedule things
further out than that), or they didn't keep everything as private as I wanted. So, I wrote a script based on 
[this blog post](https://janelloi.com/auto-sync-google-calendar/) which uses 
[this script](https://gist.github.com/ttrahan/a88febc0538315b05346f4e3b35997f2).
